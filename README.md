This admin dashboard represents the final project for the Intermediate HTML & CSS module in The Odin Project. This is originally 
designed to be a mockup of an administrator dashboard that includes a sidebar with links, a header with button links to add or 
upload new files as well as share them with relevant contact links to the administrator. There are also multiple card sections that 
make up the "article/main content" area for projects, latest announcements & what's trending.

The plan is to slightly repurpose this into a basic mock portfolio page to showcase the previous projects I've done in The Odin Project
so far.
